PIG
======

[PIG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)) is an old timey dice game that's alot of fun. So we're going to code it in Javascript and jQuery.

###The Rules

A player rolls two dice. The sum gives them a score for that turn. They can bank the turn score into their total score and end their turn, or they can roll again to try to add to their turn score.

If either of the two dice is a 1, they are a Pig. Their score for that turn is reset to 0 their turn ends.

If both dice are a 1, aka Snake-eyes, aka DOUBLE PIG, their TOTAL score is reset to 0 and their turn ends.

If they roll doubles of any other kind, they are compelled to roll again and cannot bank.

###Folder Structure

You have an empty HTML document linked to the js file and css file. You also have dice images, which should be used to represent each roll.

###Planning

Plan this with your group carefully before you write any code. Write down what classes you will need, and what functions and properties they will need to have. Discuss what responsibility each person is going to take on.

###Git Workflow

Decide how you are going to handle the Git workflow. You should probably make a new repo on your own account. Everybody should check out their own branches. Nobody should ever push to master, you should make pull requests and review them before merging them into master. You should only merge working code into the master branch.

###Code It Up

Do it!
